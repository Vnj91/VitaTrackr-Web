## 🖥️ UI & Animation Goals

### 🏠 Hero Section (Landing Page)
- Animated headline: fade-in + slide-up using Framer Motion.
- Animated subtext: slight delay for sequential entrance.
- CTA button: hover pulse + ripple click.
- Stats count-up: use `react-countup` triggered when visible.
- Trainer images: staggered fade-in and zoom.

### 📊 Dashboard Page
- Use Recharts for line + bar graphs (calories, workouts).
- Animate chart entry (fade + rise) on load.
- Progress ring animation for streak tracking.

### 🍽️ Nutrition Page
- Input box for ingredients with animated placeholder.
- AI recipe card appears with smooth spring transition.
- Allergy filter chips slide in with delay.

### 👤 Profile Page
- Animated form transitions.
- Save confirmation micro-interaction (checkmark bounce).

### ✨ Global Effects
- Subtle animated background gradient (CSS keyframes).
- Page transitions using Framer Motion `AnimatePresence`.
- Navbar + footer smooth slide-in/out.
- ScrollTrigger animations on each section.

## 🧾 Copilot Instructions
> GitHub Copilot, help me:
> 1. Scaffold the Next.js pages & layout structure following the navgraph above.  
> 2. Implement the animated hero section using Framer Motion with staggered text, button, and image animations.  
> 3. Add count-up animations for stats.  
> 4. Use GSAP or Framer for scroll-based fade/slide-in of sections.  
> 5. Set up `/nutrition` page with ingredient input and AI recipe generation (OpenAI API).  
> 6. Create `/dashboard` with animated charts and streak progress.  
> 7. Add animated transitions between pages (AnimatePresence).  
> 8. Maintain a modern, minimal Tailwind theme consistent with the landing mockup.  
> 9. Use reusable components: `Navbar`, `HeroSection`, `StatCard`, `RecipeCard`, `WorkoutChart`.  
> 10. Integrate authentication (JWT + OAuth) and MongoDB models for users, workouts, and recipes.
