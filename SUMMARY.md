## VitaTrackr — Summary of recent QoL work

This repository received a focused set of small, high-impact quality-of-life improvements across the frontend and backend, plus tests and a small repo audit. This file summarizes what changed, where to look, how to run the code/tests locally, and recommended next steps.

### High level
- Persisted several client-only features into MongoDB for authenticated users (with localStorage fallbacks).
- Implemented many small UX improvements (skeleton loaders, keyboard shortcuts, undo-able toasts, optimistic favorites, add-to-meals flows, lightweight recent meal persistence).
- Added Jest + React Testing Library tests and stabilized the test setup for the frontend.
- Performed a safe repo audit: removed a committed TypeScript build artifact (`frontend/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`) and added it to `.gitignore` (backup branch created prior to removal).

### Notable files changed
- Backend (Node/Express)
  - `backend/node/models/User.js` — added `customIngredients`, `programSubs`, `dashboardOrder`, `recentMeals` fields to persist user data.
  - `backend/node/routes/profileRoutes.js` — new endpoints to persist custom ingredient, program subscriptions, and recent meal entries (protected by auth middleware).
  - `backend/node/routes/mealsRoutes.js` — added `GET /api/meals/user/:userId` to list meals for a user.

- Frontend (Next.js app)
  - `frontend/components/RecipeCard.tsx` — add-to-meals now persists a lightweight recent meal to profile endpoint when logged-in; localStorage fallback kept.
  - `frontend/app/ingredients/page.tsx` — saving custom ingredient will call profile endpoint when logged-in; fallback to localStorage.
  - `frontend/app/programs/page.tsx` — program subscribe toggles persisted to profile endpoint when logged-in; fallback to localStorage.
  - `frontend/jest.setup.js` and `frontend/jest.config.cjs` — unit test setup for Jest + RTL.
  - Tests: `frontend/test/*` — small unit tests added and stabilized.

### How to run (local dev)
1. Start the backend (from repo root): ensure Mongo is running and then (example):

```powershell
cd backend/node
npm install
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend (from repo root):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Run frontend tests (from `frontend`):

```powershell
cd frontend
npx jest --coverage --runInBand
```

4. Linting (frontend):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

### What I verified in this session
- Frontend Jest + RTL tests pass locally (all added tests). 
- Frontend lint passes with pinned TypeScript and ESLint configuration.
- Backend model and route changes were added to persist client-side state for logged-in users (changes compile; runtime verification requires running the server with MongoDB).

### Next recommended steps (low-risk, high-value)
1. Deep repo scan for other large tracked files (>1MB) and propose candidates for untracking/removal. (I will run this next and propose a safe plan — we already created a backup branch before removing the `tsbuildinfo` file.)
2. Add integration tests for the new profile endpoints using `mongodb-memory-server` so persistence is verified end-to-end in CI.
3. Optionally add a lightweight migration: on first login, migrate localStorage vt:* keys into the server-side user document.

If you'd like, I can proceed to run the deep repo scan now and propose specific files to untrack (I'll show file sizes and suggested action). If you prefer I scaffold integration tests next, say so and I'll begin that.
